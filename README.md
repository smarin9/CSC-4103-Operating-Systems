Program 1:/n
Sudoku Solution Validator/n
This project consists of designing a multithreaded application that determines
whether the solution to a Sudoku puzzle is valid. This program uses creates a
total of 27 threads (9 for each of the rows, 9 for each of the columns, and
9 for each of the 3x3 subgrids). The solution from the text book is hardcoded
within the program itself. After running the program, the expected output
contains either "Valid Solution" or "Invalid Solution."
